# DAC/ADC Dual Core Firmware

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Firmware for sp2 Quantum GateKeeper. New features include precise timings (<300ns error) for SPI comms, new buffer ramp options, and data acquisition being in-tandem with transmission to LabRAD.

The firmware is designed to be easily extensible, as new peripherals can simply be added with little consideration for how other peripherals are written, as operations are all added independently to a centralized registry.

## Installation

This firmware is comprised of two individual PlatformIO projects, one for the M7 core and the other for the M4. To build and upload to the Arduino Giga, you need to install PlatformIO and separately upload the firmware for **both** the M7 and M4 processors (found in their respective folders). There is no extra configuration you need to do, as all processor information is contained in each project's platformio.ini file.

## Usage

This firmware uses the official PlatformIO ststm32 platform for Arduino Giga builds.

A full guide on the code structure is being developed and can currently be found [here](https://share.note.sx/n340o95a#1ld68Rexy9NMUivdsulvSYpptsx1KMYcsj4a4mlvtj4). The location of these docs may change in the future, but a link to the newest docs will always be on this GitHub repository.
